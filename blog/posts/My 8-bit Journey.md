## Pre 8-bit

Before owning my first 8-bit computer I'd had no experience with computers or programming at all. None of the subjects I was studying at school for O-level included exposure to computers. I remember that there was some sort of terminal access to a computer available in the school as my best friend at the time showed it to me during one lunch break. I don't recall what you had to be studying to get access to it. 

I must have been well aware of developments in computing though and the appearance of new home machines as I was an avid viewer of Tomorrow's World. But the exciting personal gadgets of the time (mid to late 1970s) were electronic calculators and digital watches.
## ZX81 (1982)

I bought my ZX81 some time in 1982 from my local WH Smith store in the Gracechurch Centre, Sutton Coldfield. I can't recall exactly when. I know that I was incredibly excited at the time and remember several visits to the store to look at their display and to try it out for myself. I don't think I needed much convincing and bought one using my own money (I would have been 16 or 17 and had some savings from working on Thursday and Friday evenings in Waitrose).

I then got stuck into learning BASIC, using the supplied "ZX81 BASIC Programming" manual and the ZX81 edition of the National Extension College book "30 Hour BASIC" by Clive Prigmore. My trusted Hitachi TRG-295 cassette recorder was used to save and load programmes and I soon upgraded to the wobbly 16K RAM pack secured with Blu Tac (I had the ZX-PANDA version by Stonechip Electronics). The membrane keyboard soon started splitting from all the use it was getting and I bought one of those stick-on keyboards with raised keys. I was lucky to have a small black and white portable TV in my bedroom to hook the ZX81 up to. My dad and I had bought it from an electrical store in Swansea in 1976 when we were staying in a caravan on the Gower so that we could watch the Montreal Olympics. That little TV accompanied me to University and many bed-sits beyond.

Programming was always my main use of the ZX81 and I do not recall buying many games. The only commercial software I remember is "Flight Simulation" by Psion Software. I spent many many hours playing that. 

I have one surviving listing of one of my own programmes, printed using the ZX Printer and dated 1984. This was called "Money Manager" and had the following features:

- **Open new accounts** with a named account and opening balance
    
- **Enter credits/debits** with dates, payment methods (cash/cheque), and values
    
- **Track cheques separately** with cheque number, payee, and amount
    
- **Display statements** with running balance calculations
    
- **Print to printer** 
    
- **Save/load data** to cassette tape
    
- **Memory management** - checks available RAM before adding transactions

I'll write a separate blog post about "Money Manager", but it was probably the most substantial programme I wrote on the ZX81. I submitted it to one of the magazines. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I never heard anything back!
## University Years (1983-86)

In September 1983 I headed off to Aberystwyth to study Botany (later switching to Aquatic Biology). One of my University friends was studying Computer Science which I was always slightly envious of. But natural history was another passion of mine and I never even considered Computer Science as an option. I'm guessing A-level maths was probably a requirement and I'd chosen to do A-levels in Biology, Chemistry and Economics.

I'm not sure if my ZX81 went with me or not. I certainly don't remember ever using it there. However, I do have a diary entry from 23 January 1985 noting my frustration that I was unable to get "The Fast One" to load when visiting a friend who lived some distance from campus. I can only assume that this refers to the [database programme](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/list?label_id=2160) for the ZX81 by Campbell Systems, so I must have had the ZX81 with me.

My course did include computing modules, which involved programming in BASIC and FORTRAN. From my now rather sketchy memory, I believe that there was a terminal that allowed interactive programming in BASIC, but the FORTRAN code had to be submitted on paper coding sheets. Operators then created punch cards which we then had to submit for batch processing on the mainframe (typically getting the output a day or so later). Any error in the code meant repeating the entire procedure again.

I had access to Colossal Cave Adventure - a text-based adventure game -  via the University mainframe terminals and I spent many an evening in the computer room playing that. We also had access to a Sirius 1 micro-computer (a 16-bit computer). A diary entry from January 1985 notes:

>I bought myself a floppy disc today for the Sirius micro-computer. Messed around with the WordStar word processing disc. It's great - can write letters etc. It's a bit complicated though.

I must have become proficient as I ended up writing up my dissertation using it as well as many letters to family.  Here are some extracts from a letter to my parents in February 1985, where I mention using WordStar and an upcoming computer science project:

> I am using the WordStar word processor at the moment.
> 
> Today the computer science lecturer set a project which has got to be handed in by 8/3/85 and it is part of the course assessment - so I'll have to spend what little time I get sorting that out. 
> 
> I am enclosing some examples of the graphics capabilities of the Sirius Microcomputer which Dad might be interested in. The project that we've got to do is in BASIC by-the-way so it isn't going to cause much of a problem because I know all about that whilst many of the others don't know what's going on.

At the time I regularly bought several of the Sinclair-focussed computer magazines. One of the less well known ones (compared to _Crash_, _Your Sinclair_, and *Sinclair User*) was *ZX Computing*. There were issues with the accuracy of the programme listings in magazines at that time, although *ZX Computing* seems to have had a particularly bad reputation (see [this article](https://simon.mooli.org.uk/AF/article/magazine.html) by Simon Goodwin on his experiences writing for the early home computing magazines). I clearly found this very frustrating, as this comment in the same letter to my parents confirms:

>Dad will be interested to know that I got a free computer magazine (ZX Computing) because I wrote a letter complaining about all the mistakes in the magazine whenever I buy it. So I got this months free which is worth £1.95!!!

### Commodore 16 (1985)

In March 1985 it looks like I finally reached the limits of the ZX-81 (or just couldn't cope with the frustrations of the keyboard any longer) and made the decision to upgrade. As a student, money was limited, but a special offer for the Commodore 16 (released mid 1984) proved irresistible. On Saturday 23 March 1985 I wrote in my diary:

>Didn't wake up 'till 2.25!!! Got up and went down town [and] browsed around the shops. The Commodore 16 Starter Kit - at £69 - looks a very good buy indeed - I'm getting quite interested in it - I haven't got any money at the moment though.

In a scary behaviour trait that seems to have stayed with me whenever there is a gadget that I really take a liking to; just two days later on Monday 25 March I wrote:

>Went down town this afternoon. Withdrew £70 from Building Society and bought Commodore 16 Computer (half the price it was at Xmas). As you can imagine I spent much of rest of day experimenting with it. The BASIC is very modern indeed - very similar to BASIC 86 on the SIRIUS. In evening borrowed Ian's tele (colour) to see if it was O.K. Played Punchy and one of the arcade type games. Ian and Alex came in later and had a mess around with the games and Rolf Harris Picture Builder. Didn't get to sleep 'till quite late!!

I don't remember much of what I used the Commodore 16 for, but some diary entries from April 1985 shed some light:

>Went to Sutton this afternoon. Had my hair cut at Peter's. Wandered around shops and bought 2 cassettes. Also looked at some of the CBM 16 software available - there's quite a bit coming in now including a flight simulator programme.

I do know that I was keen on text-based adventure games at that time, no doubt due to discovering  Colossal Cave Adventure on the mainframe. Though from these August 1985 diary entries it appears that I didn't find them challenging enough (especially after the legendary complexity of Colossal Cave):

> In p.m. for some reason had sudden urge to purchase Pirate Adventure (a cartridge) for my computer so went to Brum. Spent quite a bit of evening playing the adventure. Appeared very good.
> 
> Unfortunately today [the next day!] I solved the adventure - I must be too clever - I thought, god was it worth £11.95 for only 1 days usage.  Decided to send it to Commodore pretending I'd had it as a present and already had it and asking them to exchange it for Atomic Mission - another adventure - I don't know whether they will or not but I hope so!!
