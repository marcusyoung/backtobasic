## Pre 8-bit

Before owning my first 8-bit computer I'd had no experience with computers or programming at all. None of the subjects I was studying at school for O-level included exposure to computers. I remember that there was some sort of terminal access to a computer available in the school as my best friend at the time showed it to me during one lunch break. I don't recall what you had to be studying to get access to it. 

I must have been well aware of developments in computing though and the appearance of new home machines as I was an avid viewer of Tomorrow's World. But the exciting personal gadgets of the time (mid to late 1970s) were electronic calculators and digital watches.
## ZX81 (1981/2)

I bought my ZX81 some time in late 1981 or 1982 from my local WH Smith store in the Gracechurch Centre, Sutton Coldfield. I can't recall exactly when. I know that I was incredibly excited at the time and remember several visits to the store to look at their display and to try it out for myself. I don't think I needed much convincing and bought one using my own money (I would have been 16 or 17 and had some savings from working on Thursday and Friday evenings in Waitrose, Mere Green).

I then got stuck into learning BASIC, using the supplied "ZX81 BASIC Programming" manual and the ZX81 edition of the National Extension College book "30 Hour BASIC" by Clive Prigmore. My trusted Hitachi TRG-295 cassette recorder was used to save and load programmes and I soon upgraded to the wobbly 16K RAM pack secured with Blu Tac (I had the ZX-PANDA version by Stonechip Electronics). The membrane keyboard soon started splitting from all the use it was getting and and bought one of those stick-on keyboards with raised keys. I was lucky to have a small black and white portable TV in my bedroom to hook the ZX81 up to. My dad and I had bought it from an electrical store in Swansea in 1976 when we were staying in a caravan on the Gower so that we could watch the Montreal Olympics. That little TV accompanied me to University and many bed-sits beyond.

Programming was always my main use of the ZX81 and I do not recall buying many games. The only commercial software I remember is "Flight Simulation" by Psion Software. I spent many many hours playing that. 

I have one surviving listing of one of my own programmes, printed using the ZX Printer and dated 1984. This was called "Money Manager" and had the following features:

- **Open new accounts** with a named account and opening balance
    
- **Enter credits/debits** with dates, payment methods (cash/cheque), and values
    
- **Track cheques separately** with cheque number, payee, and amount
    
- **Display statements** with running balance calculations
    
- **Print to printer** 
    
- **Save/load data** to cassette tape
    
- **Memory management** - checks available RAM before adding transactions

I'll write a separate blog post about "Money Manager", but it was probably the most substantial programme I wrote on the ZX81. I submitted it to one of the magazines. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I never heard anything back!
